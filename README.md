# Exploring Differential Equations Solver

This is a project comparing different solvers for differential eqations provided in solvers.py.

## Description

This project compares the Runge-Kutta, Ralston-4 and Midpoint method in their ability to solve the predator prey model. It then generates graphs based on the results.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Jupyter notebook
* Python
